# gentrification_thesis

Created by Jordan Holliday on 10/8/2016 to convert .xls files to .csv files and then merge them into a master data file. This master data file will be merged with NYPD Historical Crime Data to complete my Master's thesis.
## To run: 
1. In terminal, go to folder with .xls files 
2. Run "convert2csv" (no quotes) to convert .xls files to .csv files and concatenate into all_data.csv
3. Run ruby "data_sum.rb"
